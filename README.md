# bin_tree

This is my practice implementation of Binary Tree and BST in Rust lang.
This attempt successfully implements the interior mutability approach using Rc<RefCell<Node>>.
There is an implementation of a cursor - an iterator over binary tree.

## There is no intention to continue this work. This is written as a practice only!
